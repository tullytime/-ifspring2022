          The Australian Shepherd is a breed of herding dog from the United States. Developed in California in the 19th century, it is claimed the breed descends from a variety of herding breeds including collies imported into California alongside sheep imported from Australia and New Zealand, the breed taking its name from the former. Originally used solely as a herding dog, the Australian Shepherd has become one of the most popular companion dog breeds in North America.

              The Australian Shepherd descends in part from pastoral dogs brought to herd Spanish flocks in North America as early as the 1500s. There is some speculation that these dogs included the Carea Leonés, a mountain sheepdog that can display the eye color and merle coat found in many contemporary Australian Shepherds.
              <br><br> It is sometimes claimed that the Basque Shepherd Dog and the Pyrenean Sheepdog were also among the ancestors of the breed. The breed as it is known today developed in California in the 19th century, as a sheep herding dog for Californian shepherds. 
              <br><br>The Australian Shepherd is believed to have developed from a variety of herding dogs imported to California with sheep imports, including collies from Australia and New Zealand, it was from these ancestors the breed took its name.

                Filled with boundless energy, the Australian shepherd was born to run free and corral a wide variety of animals. Taking an Aussie on long walks or runs is this breeds favorite activity. Make sure they’re leashed though, as Aussies will want to herd everything that moves. Due to their waterproof coat, Aussies are also known for dock diving.

                <br><br>
                A trained Aussie is a happy Aussie. Obedience training at a young age is essential for this breed, as they have a lot of energy. Aussies have a protective streak, so make sure they understand boundaries for your family and people who visit your home. Due to their high energy, they shouldn’t be left alone for long periods of time as they may start destroying your property in protest. Luckily though, due to their high intelligence and worker dog needs, the Aussie is highly trainable and wants to do a good job!

            <p>
              Australian Shepherds are generally a healthy breed, but they can have several health problems. Vision problems are common, and epilepsy is also a concern. In merle-to-merle breeding, the puppies that have inherited two copies of the merle gene have an increased risk of being born blind or deaf.
